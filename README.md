> ### :speech_balloon: The benefit of using PostgreSQL DB table compared to a NoSQL Database in this project
>  - excel at combing tables with similar features using JOIN and UNION operations
>  - allowing better organization, and validation of data which means that we can separate the big table into samll tables and relate them with the key
>  - better supporting complex SQL queries than NoSQL DB

## Steps and Notes for running project.ipynb
### Task I
- All of 15 .csv data files with 110 original features & 2 columns of `year` and `gender` have been uploaded in the Postgres table named `fifa`
- Total male+female players: 144323 (distinct w.r.t. 111 features)

### Task II

*Note:* "use only male player data for your analysis tasks (Tasks 2 and 3)"

**Question 1**
- Defined function `query_no_clubs(X, Y, Z)` to finish the task of "find the Y clubs with the highest number of players in year X with contracts ending in year Z"
  - input required: year as `X`, the number of clubs (positive integer) that want to display as `Y`, year of a contract ending as `Z`
  - output: the `Y` clubs' name and there players number in year `X` with contracts ending in year `Z`
    
  <details> 
  <summary> Function testing </summary>
    
  - Possible value for year X: [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022]
  - Possible value for contract ending year Z (hold the value of 2023 or after): [2031, 2026, 2028, 2025, 2023, 2024, 2027]
  </details>

**Question 2**
- Defined function `top_avg_age_clubs(X, Y, filter)` to finish the task of "list the X clubs with the highest (or lowest) average player age for a given year Y"
  - input required: club ranking as `X`, year as `Y`, option to choose from "highest" or "lowest" ranking as `filter`
  - output: list of `X` clubs with the `filter` average player age for a given year `Y`

**Question 3**
- Defined function `display_popular_nation()` to illustract the most popular nationality in the dataset for each year
  - input: nothing
  - output: list of popular nationality for each year

### Task III

#### Data Engineering

Prediction target: `value_eur`

 - **Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing**

    - player_position,club_name,preferred_foot -> one-hot
    - club_contract_valid_until - club_joined -> contact time period 
    - work_rate -> split into attacking / defensive -> one-hot
    - drop columns that are not of interest

  - **Handle missing value**

    - value_eur: drop the rows with "NULL"
