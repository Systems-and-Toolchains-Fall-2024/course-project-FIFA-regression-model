> ### :speech_balloon: The benefit of using PostgreSQL DB table compared to a NoSQL Database in this project
>  - excel at combing tables with similar features using JOIN and UNION operations
>  - allowing better organization, and validation of data which means that we can separate the big table into samll tables and relate them with the key
>  - better supporting complex SQL queries than NoSQL DB
